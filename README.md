# Klipper-config-for-Longer-Lk4-manta-e3ez-Tmc-2209-drivers
this is the config file I use for my longer lk4 that i modded with the manta e3ez motherboard and 2209 drivers, along with a bltouch 
just make sure you add both Start.cfg and printer.cfg to your 3d printer's interface, i use mainsail.
also i changed the mesh_min and the Mesh_max settings to account for the bed clips i am using
